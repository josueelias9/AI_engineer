# üå± Diamond Sow Gardens ‚Äì AI Solution Proposal

---

## Overview ‚Äì About
- Diamond Sow Gardens specializes in sustainable agriculture and research  
- Located in New Mexico, with partnerships including Los Alamos National Labs  
- Mission: advance **organic and biodynamic farming practices** using technology  

---

## Overview ‚Äì Current State
- üå°Ô∏è Sensor data (Ubibot, Davis Instruments) already collected in real time  
- ‚úÖ Basic automation in place (temperature-based sidewall control)  
- ‚ùå Pain points:
  - No AI-based analysis of infrared spectrometry data  
  - Limited ability to **predict disease/deficiencies**  
  - Difficulty correlating multi-source data (humidity, moonlight, temperature, wind)  
  - Lack of automated **report generation and recommendations**  

---

## Overview ‚Äì Goals
- üìä Build AI-driven monitoring for **plant health and production optimization**  
- ‚ö° Enable real-time **trigger-based alerts and recommendations**  
- üåø Vertical focus: cucumber downy mildew prevention  
- ü§ñ Develop an **agentic system**: from reporting ‚Üí to recommending ‚Üí to automating actions  

---

# üéØ Use Cases (POC Focus)

---

## Use Case 1 ‚Äì AI Reports from Sensor Data
- **Problem:** Sensor data is raw and fragmented, difficult to interpret manually  
- **POC Solution:**  
  - Use GCP (BigQuery + Vertex AI) to process Ubibot data  
  - Train models to identify anomalies & generate **natural language reports**  
- **Outcome:** Automated, reliable reporting of plant health indicators  

---

## Use Case 2 ‚Äì Cucumber Downy Mildew Prediction
- **Problem:** Disease prediction requires combining humidity, temperature, wind, and spectrometry  
- **POC Solution:**  
  - Develop ML classification model for mildew risk levels  
  - Trigger recommendations for potassium application  
- **Outcome:** Early warnings, optimized treatment timing, reduced crop loss  

---

## Use Case 3 ‚Äì Actionable Alerts & Triggers
- **Problem:** Farmers need timely, actionable steps (not just raw data)  
- **POC Solution:**  
  - Build AI agents to recommend actions (alerts via mobile/web)  
  - Future-ready integration with irrigation automation systems  
- **Outcome:** Human-in-the-loop decision making ‚Üí path toward automation

# üèóÔ∏è Architecture

## Proposed Architecture
Here should be the diagram `image_1_architecture`.

---

# üìä Estimate

---

## Scrum-Based Estimation
Here should be a summary table of epics and stories.  
(Full CSV provided separately).  

---

# üöÄ Next Steps
1. Confirm cucumber downy mildew dataset and triggers  
2. Define success metrics for AI reports (precision, recall, farmer usability)  
3. Build initial pipeline in GCP (BigQuery + Vertex AI + Pub/Sub)  
4. Deliver **POC in 6‚Äì8 weeks**  
5. Evaluate results and scale to additional crops

## what should be said in each slide

```markdown
### Slide 1
Welcome everyone. Today we will present how AI can be leveraged to improve agricultural monitoring and automation at Diamond Sow Gardens.

### Slide 2
About Diamond Sow Gardens: a sustainable agriculture company in New Mexico, combining traditional farming practices with modern research. We aim to enhance plant health and production through advanced technologies.

### Slide 3
Currently, the farm already collects real-time data via Ubibot and Davis sensors, and has basic automation for greenhouse temperature. However, there are limitations: no advanced AI analysis, difficulty predicting diseases, and no automatic actionable reports.

### Slide 4
The goal is to move beyond simple monitoring, into AI-driven reporting and action recommendations. We will start with a vertical case: cucumber downy mildew. Long-term, the system should evolve into a fully agentic solution that can automate interventions.

### Slide 5
We identified three use cases for a proof-of-concept. These are designed to address the main pain points without committing to a full deployment.

### Slide 6
First use case: generating AI reports from sensor data. This will automate the interpretation of raw readings, giving farmers clear reports on health indicators.

### Slide 7
Second use case: cucumber downy mildew prediction. By combining environmental and spectrometry data, we can train an AI model to forecast mildew risk, enabling proactive treatment.

### Slide 8
Third use case: actionable alerts. AI agents will recommend concrete actions, starting with human-in-the-loop alerts, but designed for future automation with irrigation systems.

### Slide 9
Here is the proposed architecture. It shows how sensor data flows into GCP (Pub/Sub ‚Üí BigQuery ‚Üí Vertex AI), producing reports and recommendations. Agentic systems will deliver alerts, and in future phases, trigger automated irrigation or treatment.

### Slide 10
For estimation, we used Scrum methodology. Each epic and user story was broken into tasks. We ensured the plan is flexible enough for exploration while keeping delivery within 6‚Äì8 weeks for the POC.

### Slide 11
Next steps: confirm the cucumber dataset, define success metrics, set up GCP pipeline, and build the POC. After evaluation, we can scale to more crops and expand automation.

Do you want me to also prepare **two additional supporting diagrams** (e.g., one for the cucumber mildew use case data flow, and another for the agentic alert system), so that the presentation has multiple visuals instead of just the general architecture?
